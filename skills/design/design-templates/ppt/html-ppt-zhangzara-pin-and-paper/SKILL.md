# Pin & Paper

> Yellow paper with safety-pin illustrations, ink-blue handwritten Caveat, paper-grain texture.

A single self-contained HTML deck — typography, palette, decorative system,
and slide vocabulary are all tuned together. Mixing layouts across templates
breaks the system; stay inside this one.

## At a glance

- **Scheme:** light
- **Formality:** medium
- **Density:** medium
- **Slides in demo:** 11

## Best for

Anything that should feel hand-crafted, warm, and literary: qualitative research findings, founder reflections, longform brand stories, workshop debriefs. The signature safety-pin illustrations and paper-grain texture make it especially good for any deck — including tech or business — that wants personality and warmth over polish.

## Avoid for

Decks that need to feel digital-native polished or rigorously data-driven — handwritten Caveat is intentionally informal.

## Workflow

1. **Use `pattern.html` and `assets/` only as secondary pattern references.** Do not clone them wholesale; extract rhythm, structure, and required runtime behavior, then rebuild for the current brief.
   This template ships an `assets/deck-stage.js` runtime (keyboard navigation,
   stage rendering) and an `assets/styles.css` stylesheet. The HTML references
   them as `assets/deck-stage.js` and `assets/styles.css`, so both must sit next
   to the cloned HTML or those paths will 404 in the generated artifact and
   navigation/styling will silently break. Inlining the JS/CSS into a single
   `<script>`/`<style>` block in the HTML is an acceptable alternative when a
   single self-contained file is preferred.
2. **Replace placeholder content** with the user's real headlines, body copy,
   numbers, names, dates, and section labels. Match existing dimensions when
   swapping image placeholders.
3. **Preserve the design system.** Never substitute fonts, recolor the palette,
   restructure the layout grid, or strip decorative elements (corner brackets,
   paper grain, geometric shapes, illustrated SVGs). They are part of the
   identity.
4. **Adjust deck length by duplicating layouts.** If the user has more content
   than the demo holds, duplicate an existing slide of the most appropriate
   layout. If less, drop slides from the bottom. Update page-number labels.
5. **Designing missing layouts:** if a slide needs a layout the template
   doesn't have, design it from scratch using the same fonts, palette,
   decorative vocabulary, spacing rhythm, and component grammar — never bail
   to a different template.
6. **Keep the navigation runtime as shipped.** If the deck ships an
   `assets/deck-stage.js` or inline keyboard handler, leave it intact.

## Output contract

Emit between `<artifact>` tags:

```
<artifact identifier="zhangzara-pin-and-paper" type="text/html" title="Deck Title">
<!doctype html>
<html>...</html>
</artifact>
```
